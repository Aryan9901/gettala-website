## <a name="howtoplay">🤸 How to Play</a>

Certainly! Here's a basic guide on how to play the Pig Dice game:

👉 Player Turn: 
### Setup
- The game is played with two players and one six-sided die.

### Turns
- Players take turns rolling the die.
- A player can roll the die as many times as they want until they roll a 1.

### Scoring
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends.
- If they roll a number other than 1, the number rolled is added to their turn total.
- A player can choose to roll again or hold onto their current turn total and pass the die to the other player.

### Winning
- The first player to reach or exceed 100 points at the end of their turn wins the game.

### Strategy
- Decide whether to play conservatively and hold onto your points or take risks to accumulate more points in a turn.
- Pay attention to your opponent's score and adjust your strategy accordingly.
